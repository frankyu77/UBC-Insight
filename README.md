## Setup and Install the Project.
To start using this project, you need to get your computer configured so you can build and execute the code.
To do this, follow these steps; the specifics of each step (especially the first two) will vary based on which operating system your computer has:

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). After installing you should be able to execute `git --version` on the command line.

1. [Install Node v18](https://nodejs.org/en/about/previous-releases), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute `node --version` and `npm --version` on the command line).

1. [Install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). You should be able to execute `yarn --version` afterwards.

1. Clone the repository by running `git clone REPO_URL` from the command line. You can get the REPO_URL by clicking on the green button on your project repository page on GitHub.

1. From the command line `cd` into the correct folder where the root of the cloned repository is located

1. Once in the correct directory run `npm install` on the command line to download all the correct dependencies.

1. Run `yarn start` on the command line to run the local server.

1. To start the frontend, run `cd frontend` and `npm start` on the command line. This should have the frontend webpage on a browser.
